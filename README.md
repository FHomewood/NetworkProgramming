# Network Programming

This repository is containing all of my projects created in my introduction to Socket Programming in C# using the MonoGame (XNA) framework and other contexts.



It currently contains two projects that implement Socket programming in different ways,

* A1 is a simple Server - Terminal communication using limited buffers to send data between two console windows using hard coded commands.
* A2 is an implementation of A1 in an XNA Windows project, using limited buffers to send console positional data between the terminals and update all of the console positions in real time.

## Aims
This software is produced by me, an individual developer, for the purposes of self improvement. Below is a list of aims that I hope this project will help me achieve:

* A basic knowledge of how software communicate between different instances on multiple machines using sockets.
* Gain an understanding of how to implement online functionality into programs.
